# Super Resolution Generation with Efficient Sub-Pixel (SRGAN)

## Introduction

* Efficient Sub-Pixel is a model that reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image given a low-resolution version. It takes advantage of efficient "sub-pixel convolution" layers, which learn a series of image scaling filters.
